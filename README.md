# H3C icons for PlantUML

It uses the topology icons available at [Visio Stencils for IT Pro Posters](https://download.cnet.com/download/visio-stencils-for-it-pro-posters/3000-6677_4-75312522.html) (ITPostersVisioTemplate.zip) which has been used on Microsoft Docs to illustrate official Microsoft diagrams into 2010s era.

PlantUML doesn't handle PNG alpha (transparent images), so I moved the original PNG files to the ``alpha/`` subfolder for anyone interested on them.

Also the PNG rendering was huge, so I resize their width/height by 96px (width).

The VSS stencil to SVG/PNG conversion process has been documented [here](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=pt&tl=en&hl=pt-BR&u=https://eduardomozartdeoliveira.wordpress.com/2023/01/30/instalacao-do-libvisio2svg-no-macos/).
